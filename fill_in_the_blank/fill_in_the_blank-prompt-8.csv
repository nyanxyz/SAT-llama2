You will be provided with passage to use for creating 'fill in the blank' type question.
Your task is to generate 'fill in the blank' SAT-style reading comprehension passage, question, and answer set using the provided passage by following these steps:

Step 1 - Blank Setting: Carefully read the passage and select a key word or sentence that plays a significant role in the context. This word or sentence should be pivotal to the passage's meaning and its removal would significantly impact the flow of the text.
Step 2 - Question Formation: Choose one of the following question formats to use:
'Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?'
'Which choice most logically completes the text?'
Step 3 - Creating Distractors: Develop three distractors that are contextually or semantically similar to the selected word or sentence from Step 1, but differ slightly. These choices should be plausible within the context yet not the correct answer. Ensure these choices vary in vocabulary complexity.
Step 4 - Output Format: Present the output in JSON format with the following structure:
""passage"": The original passage with the key word or sentence replaced by a blank indicated as ________.
""question"": The selected question format from step 2.
""answer"": The correct answer identified in step 1.
""distractors"": The list of distractors developed in step 3, formatted as [{choice1}, {choice2}, {choice3}]. Each choice should not exceed 15 words.

Your task is to generate 'fill in the blank' SAT-style reading comprehension passage, question, and answer set using the provided passage by following these steps:

Step 1 - Blank Setting: Carefully read the passage and select a key word or sentence that plays a significant role in the context. This word or sentence should be pivotal to the passage's meaning and its removal would significantly impact the flow of the text.
Step 2 - Question Formation: Choose one of the following question formats to use:
'Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?'
'Which choice most logically completes the text?'
Step 3 - Creating Distractors: Develop three distractors that are contextually or semantically similar to the selected word or sentence from Step 1, but differ slightly. These choices should be plausible within the context yet not the correct answer. Ensure these choices vary in vocabulary complexity.
Step 4 - Output Format: Present the output in JSON format with the following structure:
""passage"": The original passage with the key word or sentence replaced by a blank indicated as ________.
""question"": The selected question format from step 2.
""answer"": The correct answer identified in step 1.
""distractors"": The list of distractors developed in step 3, formatted as [{choice1}, {choice2}, {choice3}]. Each choice should not exceed 15 words.

For example:

{
  ""passage"": ""passage with ________"",
  ""question"": ""question selected from step 2"",
  ""answer"": ""correct answer identified in step 1"",
  ""distractors"": [""distractor 1"", ""distractor 2"", ""distractor 3""]

Many of William Shakespeare’s tragedies address broad themes that still appeal to today’s audiences. For instance, Romeo and Juliet, which is set in the Italy of Shakespeare’s time, tackles the themes of parents versus children and love versus hate, and the play continues to be read and produced widely around the world. But understanding Shakespeare’s so-called history plays can require a knowledge of several centuries of English history. Consequently, many theatergoers and readers today are likely to find Shakespeare’s history plays less engaging than the tragedies. [/INST] {

fill in the blank,"Ancestral Puebloans, the civilization from which present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as early as 1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys. Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus, researchers concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried farming practices with them.","Ancestral Puebloans, the civilization from which present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as early as 1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys.
