Reasoning,"Given that stars and planets initially form from the same gas and dust in space, some astronomers have posited that host stars (such as the Sun) and their planets (such as those in our solar system) are composed of the same materials, with the planets containing equal or smaller quantities of the materials that make up the host star. This idea is also supported by evidence that rocky planets in our solar system are composed of some of the same materials as the Sun.","Given that stars and planets initially form from the same gas and dust in space, some astronomers have posited that host stars (such as the Sun) and their planets (such as those in our solar system) are composed of the same materials, with the planets containing equal or smaller quantities of the materials that make up the host star.

Reasoning,"In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a concerted effort to collect Mexican American folklore, but they did not always agree about that folklore’s origins.

fill in the blank,"A team of biologists led by Jae-Hoon Jung, Antonio D.

find response,"Text 1 Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. Text 2 When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear.","Text 1 Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin.

Reasoning,"Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically.

Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many
efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t

Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have
connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their

makes it hard for them to move around and interact

otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing
on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada,
the otter population is large and well established,

this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and

meadows to meadows where otters are absent or

Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene
pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that
damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of
sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic
diversity, which benefits the meadow’s health overall. ","When digging for clams, their primary food, sea

reputation as one of the best places to view
contemporary art from around the world. According
to an arts journalist, later in his career as a renowned
curator and art historian, Enwezor sought to remedy
this deficiency, not by focusing solely on modern
African artists, but by showing how their work fits
into the larger context of global modern art and art
history. ","Which finding, if true, would most directly support
the journalist’s claim? ","A) As curator of the Haus der Kunst in Munich,
Germany, Enwezor organized a retrospective of
Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui’s work entitled El
Anatsui: Triumphant Scale, one of the largest art
exhibitions devoted to a Black artist in Europe’s
history.
B) In the exhibition Postwar: Art Between the Pacific
and the Atlantic, 1945–1965, Enwezor and
cocurator Katy Siegel brought works by African
artists such as Malangatana Ngwenya together
with pieces by major figures from other
countries, like US artist Andy Warhol and
Mexico’s David Siqueiros.
C) Enwezor’s work as curator of the 2001 exhibition
The Short Century: Independence and Liberation
Movements in Africa, 1945–1994 showed how
African movements for independence from
European colonial powers following the Second
World War profoundly influenced work by
African artists of the period, such as Kamala
Ibrahim Ishaq and Thomas Mukarobgwa.
D) Enwezor organized the exhibition In/sight:
African Photographers, 1940 to the Present not to
emphasize a particular aesthetic trend but to
demonstrate the broad range of ways in which
African artists have approached the medium of
photography. ","In the exhibition Postwar: Art Between the Pacific

Reasoning,"Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón and her team
have investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed
flycatcher bird that live in the same region in
Colombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part
of the year, and the other doesn’t. The researchers
found that, due to slight differences in feather shape,
the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher
males make a sound during flight that is higher
pitched than that made by the feathers of
nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize
that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the
specific sound made by the males of their own
subspecies, and that over time the females’
preference will drive further genetic and anatomical
divergence between the subspecies. ","Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón and her team

Reasoning,"Art collectives, like the United States- and Vietnambased collective The Propeller Group or Cuba’s Los
Carpinteros, are groups of artists who agree to work

the reasons, art collectives usually involve some
collaboration among the artists. Based on a recent
